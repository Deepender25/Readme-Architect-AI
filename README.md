## ‚≠ê Overview
GeminiDocs AI is an innovative, open-source tool designed to revolutionize how developers create and maintain documentation for their code repositories, leveraging the power of Google's advanced Gemini Pro AI.

> Navigating the complexities of open-source projects or even internal codebases often begins with a well-structured, informative `README.md`. Yet, crafting a comprehensive and up-to-date README is a time-consuming task, frequently neglected amidst development priorities. This leads to outdated documentation, steeper learning curves for new contributors, and a diminished appeal for otherwise excellent projects.

GeminiDocs AI provides an elegant solution by automating the entire README generation process. By analyzing a given code repository, it intelligently extracts crucial information about the project's structure, purpose, and dependencies. This deep analysis is then synthesized into a highly detailed and structured prompt, which is sent to Google Gemini Pro to generate a professional, accurate, and stunning `README.md` file, all through an intuitive web interface.

**Inferred Architecture:**
This project operates as a robust web service with a clear separation of concerns. The backend, built with Python, orchestrates the core logic: repository cloning, sophisticated code analysis, advanced prompt engineering, and interaction with the Google Gemini Pro API. The frontend, crafted with standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), provides an intuitive and accessible user interface, allowing users to effortlessly submit repository URLs and retrieve their generated READMEs. Temporary files and cloned repositories are meticulously managed for secure and efficient processing.

## ‚ú® Key Features
-   **Automated Repository Cloning:** Securely clones specified public Git repositories for in-depth analysis, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the codebase.
-   **Sophisticated Codebase Analysis:** Intelligently scans the cloned repository, identifying file structures, programming languages, potential dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt`), and key functions or classes to accurately describe the project's core functionalities. The `check_models.py` utility likely contributes to validating the integrity or structure of these analyses.
-   **Advanced Prompt Engineering:** Dynamically constructs massively improved, highly-detailed, and structured prompts tailored for the Gemini Pro API, ensuring optimal context and guidance for superior README generation.
-   **Gemini Pro Powered README Generation:** Leverages the state-of-the-art Google Gemini Pro model to generate professional, well-structured, and contextually relevant `README.md` files based on the analyzed codebase.
-   **Intuitive Web Interface:** Provides a user-friendly frontend (`static/app.js`, `index.html`, `style.css`) for seamless interaction, allowing users to input repository URLs and trigger the README generation process with ease.
-   **Ephemeral Processing & Cleanup:** Automatically cleans up cloned repositories and temporary files after analysis and README generation, ensuring data privacy and efficient resource utilization.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a copy of GeminiDocs AI up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   **Python 3.9+**
*   **Git** (for cloning repositories)
*   **Google Gemini API Key:** You'll need an API key from Google AI Studio. Set this as an environment variable (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY`).

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/GeminiDocs-AI.git
    cd GeminiDocs-AI
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    *(Note: While `requirements.txt` is listed in the file structure, its content was not provided. The following command assumes it will contain necessary Python libraries.)*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Expected dependencies include `google-generativeai`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `gitpython`, etc.*

4.  **Set up your Gemini API Key:**
    Export your API key as an environment variable:
    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    # For Windows Command Prompt: set GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    # For Windows PowerShell: $env:GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    ```
    Replace `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"` with your actual key.

## üîß Usage

Once installed, you can run the application and access its web interface.

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    From the project root directory, run:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    This will start the FastAPI server, typically accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2.  **Access the Web Interface:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/index.html`.
    You will be presented with the GeminiDocs AI interface.

3.  **Generate a README:**
    *   Enter the URL of the Git repository you wish to document (e.g., `https://github.com/some-user/some-repo`).
    *   Click the "Generate README" button.
    *   The application will clone the repository, analyze its codebase, create a detailed prompt, and send it to Gemini Pro.
    *   Once the generation is complete, the new `README.md` content will be displayed, ready for you to copy and integrate into your project.
