## ‚≠ê Overview

AutoDoc AI is an innovative, open-source project designed to revolutionize how developers generate and maintain project documentation by leveraging advanced AI capabilities.

> The challenge of maintaining accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date `README.md` files for software projects, especially open-source repositories, is a pervasive pain point for developers. Manual documentation is time-consuming, prone to inconsistencies, and often neglected, leading to poor onboarding experiences and reduced project discoverability.

AutoDoc AI provides an elegant solution by automating the creation of high-quality, structured `README.md` files. It intelligently analyzes your codebase, understands its underlying purpose and structure, and then crafts a detailed and professional `README` using the power of Google's Gemini Pro AI model. This ensures your projects are always well-documented, saving countless hours and fostering better collaboration.

### Inferred Architecture

AutoDoc AI operates as a robust web service with a clear separation of concerns. The core logic resides in a Python backend (inferred to be built with FastAPI), responsible for handling repository cloning, deep codebase analysis, sophisticated AI prompt engineering, and interaction with the Google Gemini Pro API. A lightweight, modern web frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) provides an intuitive user interface, allowing users to effortlessly submit repository URLs and retrieve their AI-generated documentation. This architecture ensures high performance, scalability, and ease of use.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **üåê Remote Repository Cloning:** Seamlessly clones public or private (with authentication) Git repositories for analysis, supporting a wide range of code sources.
*   **üß† Intelligent Codebase Analysis:** Performs deep static analysis of the cloned codebase, identifying project structure, inferred technologies, core functionalities, and potential features to inform the README generation.
*   **‚úçÔ∏è Advanced AI Prompt Engineering:** Dynamically constructs highly detailed, context-rich, and structured prompts specifically optimized for large language models (LLMs) like Google Gemini Pro, ensuring relevant and high-quality output.
*   **üöÄ AI-Powered README Generation:** Leverages the formidable capabilities of Google Gemini Pro to generate comprehensive, well-structured, and professionally written `README.md` files tailored to the analyzed codebase.
*   **üßπ Automated Repository Cleanup:** Ensures local system hygiene by automatically removing cloned repositories after the documentation generation process is complete.
*   **üñ•Ô∏è Intuitive Web Interface:** Offers a user-friendly web application for easy interaction, allowing users to simply paste a repository URL and receive their generated README.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get AutoDoc AI up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python 3.10+**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **Git**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
*   **Google Gemini API Key**: Obtain one from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AutoDoc-AI.git
    cd AutoDoc-AI
    ```

2.  **Set up a virtual environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    *   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    While a `requirements.txt` file was not found in the initial analysis, you will need to install the core dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install fastapi uvicorn python-dotenv google-generativeai
    ```
    *(Note: You might consider creating a `requirements.txt` file in the root directory for future use: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*

5.  **Configure your Google Gemini API Key:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Gemini API key:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    Replace `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"` with the actual API key you obtained.

## üîß Usage

Once you have completed the installation and configuration, you can run AutoDoc AI:

1.  **Start the application:**
    From the root directory of the project (with your virtual environment activated):
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The `--reload` flag is useful for development as it automatically reloads the server on code changes.

2.  **Access the Web Interface:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You will see the AutoDoc AI user interface where you can input a repository URL and initiate the README generation process.

3.  **(Optional) Interact via API:**
    If you wish to integrate with AutoDoc AI programmatically, you can send POST requests to the `/generate` endpoint.
    Example (using `curl`):
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/generate" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{
               "repo_url": "https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife",
               "target_branch": "main",
               "output_format": "markdown"
             }'
    ```
    *Note: The actual request body parameters will be based on the `RepoRequest` class structure in `main.py`.*
