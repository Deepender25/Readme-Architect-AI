## ‚≠ê Overview
AutoDoc AI is an innovative open-source tool that revolutionizes documentation by automating the creation of comprehensive, highly-detailed, and professional README files for any given codebase using advanced Artificial Intelligence.

> üö´ **The Problem:** Developers often face the arduous task of creating and maintaining up-to-date READMEs. This process is time-consuming, prone to inconsistencies, and frequently overlooked, leading to poorly documented projects that hinder collaboration, onboarding, and discoverability. Manual documentation drains valuable engineering time, pulling focus away from core development.

üí° **The Solution:** AutoDoc AI leverages sophisticated code analysis and cutting-edge large language models to intelligently understand a repository's structure, purpose, and functionality. It then crafts a structured, articulate, and complete `README.md` file, freeing developers to focus on building, while ensuring projects are always impeccably documented.

**Inferred Architecture:** AutoDoc AI operates as a robust web application, featuring a Python backend built with modern frameworks (likely FastAPI for its asynchronous capabilities and speed) that orchestrates repository cloning, deep code analysis, and sophisticated AI prompt engineering. This backend seamlessly integrates with Google's Gemini Pro model for the core README generation. A clean, responsive frontend, powered by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides an intuitive user interface for submitting repository URLs and viewing generated documentation, creating a seamless end-to-end experience.

## ‚ú® Key Features
-   **Intelligent Repository Cloning:** Securely clones specified public Git repositories to perform localized analysis, ensuring data privacy and efficient processing.
-   **Deep Codebase Analysis:** Performs comprehensive static analysis of the cloned codebase, extracting critical information about its structure, dependencies, functions, and overall intent.
-   **Advanced AI Prompt Engineering:** Dynamically constructs massively improved, highly-detailed, and structured prompts tailored for optimal performance with advanced large language models. This ensures the AI receives precise context for superior output.
-   **Seamless Gemini Pro Integration:** Leverages the power of Google's state-of-the-art Gemini Pro model to generate high-quality, contextually relevant, and well-structured README files.
-   **Automated README Generation:** Transforms complex code insights into clear, concise, and professional documentation, including sections like overview, features, setup, and usage.
-   **Temporary Files Cleanup:** Automatically removes cloned repositories and temporary files after processing, maintaining system hygiene and privacy.
-   **Intuitive Web Interface:** Provides a user-friendly frontend for submitting repository URLs and viewing the generated READMEs directly within the browser, simplifying the entire process.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get AutoDoc AI up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   Git (for cloning repositories)
*   A Google Gemini API Key (obtainable from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/))

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AutoDocAI.git # Replace with actual repo URL
    cd AutoDocAI
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    *   On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install project dependencies:**
    *(Note: A `requirements.txt` file is not provided in the source. You will need to install the inferred dependencies. It is recommended to create a `requirements.txt` from these for production.)*
    ```bash
    pip install fastapi uvicorn google-generativeai python-dotenv # Add other necessary libraries like gitpython if used
    ```

5.  **Set up your Gemini API Key:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project (`tmpxlnjrt3i/`) and add your Gemini API key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

## üîß Usage

Once the dependencies are installed and your API key is configured, you can run the AutoDoc AI application:

1.  **Start the Uvicorn server:**
    Ensure your virtual environment is active.
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The `--reload` flag is useful for development as it automatically reloads the server on code changes.

2.  **Access the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (or `http://localhost:8000`).

3.  **Generate a README:**
    *   On the web interface, enter the URL of the Git repository you wish to document (e.g., `https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi`).
    *   Click the "Generate README" button.
    *   The application will clone the repository, analyze its contents, and use Gemini Pro to generate a comprehensive README, which will then be displayed in the browser.
