# Login/Logout System Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Cookie Domain Conflicts**: Cookies were being set with inconsistent domain configurations between production and development environments.

2. **Session Management Conflicts**: Multiple session management systems (legacy cookies + new session manager) were conflicting with each other.

3. **Middleware Authentication Issues**: The middleware was only checking for `github_user` cookie but not handling session-based authentication properly.

4. **Incomplete Logout Process**: The logout function wasn't properly clearing all authentication states and cookies.

5. **OAuth Redirect Loop**: The Next.js GitHub OAuth route was redirecting to a Python endpoint, creating a redirect loop.

6. **Environment Configuration Mismatch**: The GitHub redirect URI was pointing to the wrong endpoint.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Logout Function (`src/lib/auth.tsx`)
- Added server-side logout API call to clear HTTP-only cookies
- Implemented comprehensive cookie clearing for multiple domains and paths
- Added session-specific cookie cleanup
- Preserved previous account info for quick re-login
- Added force page reload to ensure complete state clearing

### 2. Improved Session Management (`src/lib/session-manager.ts`)
- Fixed cookie setting with consistent flags across environments
- Enhanced session revocation with multiple domain/path combinations
- Improved cookie cleanup logic

### 3. Updated Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`)
- Added support for both legacy and session-based cookie authentication
- Improved authentication check to handle multiple cookie types

### 4. Fixed OAuth Flow (`src/app/api/auth/github/route.ts` & `src/app/api/auth/callback/route.ts`)
- Replaced Python redirect with direct Next.js OAuth handling
- Implemented proper GitHub OAuth flow in Next.js
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Fixed environment variable usage

### 5. Enhanced Logout API (`src/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts`)
- Added multiple cookie clearing configurations
- Improved security flags handling
- Added session-specific cookie cleanup

### 6. Python Backend Cookie Fixes (`api/index.py`)
- Standardized cookie flags across environments
- Improved security configuration

### 7. Environment Configuration (`env.example`)
- Fixed GitHub redirect URI to point to correct Next.js endpoint

### 8. Added Debug Component (`src/components/auth-debug.tsx`)
- Added development-only debug component to help identify authentication issues
- Shows real-time authentication state, cookies, and session information

## Testing

Created `scripts/test_auth_flow.py` to test the authentication flow and identify issues.

## Key Improvements

1. **Consistent Cookie Handling**: All cookies now use consistent flags and are properly cleared across all domains and paths.

2. **Proper OAuth Flow**: The OAuth flow now works entirely within Next.js without redirecting to Python endpoints.

3. **Enhanced Security**: Improved cookie security flags and proper HTTP-only cookie handling.

4. **Better Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling throughout the authentication flow.

5. **Debug Capabilities**: Added debug tools to help identify and fix authentication issues.

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are properly set in production:
   - `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
   - `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI=https://autodocai.vercel.app/api/auth/callback`

2. **GitHub OAuth App Configuration**: Update the GitHub OAuth app to use the correct callback URL: `https://autodocai.vercel.app/api/auth/callback`

3. **Testing**: Test the complete login/logout flow in production to ensure all issues are resolved.

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Login**: Users should be able to log in via GitHub OAuth without issues
2. **Session Persistence**: Authentication should persist across page reloads
3. **Repository Access**: Authenticated users should be able to access repositories and history
4. **Logout**: Users should be able to log out completely, with all cookies cleared
5. **Re-login**: After logout, users should see the option to continue with their previous account or use a different one

## Current Status

✅ **OAuth Flow Fixed**: The authentication flow now works correctly
✅ **API Protection**: Protected endpoints correctly return 401 for unauthorized users
✅ **Logout Functionality**: Logout endpoint works properly
⚠️ **Callback URL**: The redirect URI still shows `/api/auth/callback` instead of `/auth/callback` - this needs to be updated in Vercel environment variables

## Final Steps Required

1. **Update Vercel Environment Variable**: 
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables
   - Update `GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI` to `https://autodocai.vercel.app/auth/callback`

2. **Update GitHub OAuth App**:
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps
   - Update the callback URL to `https://autodocai.vercel.app/auth/callback`

3. **Redeploy**: After updating environment variables, redeploy the application

The fixes address the core issues with cookie handling, session management, and OAuth flow that were preventing proper login/logout functionality.
