# Authentication Persistence Fix

## Problem
The authentication state was not persisting after page reload. Users would see the "Sign in" button even after successful authentication until they closed and reopened the tab.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the authentication flow logic in `src/lib/auth.tsx`. The code was:
1. Prioritizing URL parameters over cookies during auth check
2. Not properly parsing cookies on page reload
3. Having race conditions in the authentication state management

## Solution

### 1. Improved Cookie Parsing
- Added a utility function `getCookieValue()` for reliable cookie extraction
- Fixed the cookie parsing logic to handle edge cases
- Prioritized persistent cookie state over temporary URL parameters

### 2. Enhanced Authentication Flow
- **Before**: Checked URL parameter first, then cookie
- **After**: Check cookie first (persistent state), then URL parameter (callback only)
- This ensures that existing sessions are restored immediately on page load

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling for cookie parsing
- Clear invalid cookies automatically
- Better logging for debugging authentication issues

### 4. State Management Improvements
- Added storage event listener to sync auth state across tabs
- Improved loading state management
- Added manual refresh capability

## Key Changes Made

### In `src/lib/auth.tsx`:

1. **Added Cookie Utility Function**:
```typescript
const getCookieValue = (name: string): string | null => {
  const cookies = document.cookie.split(';');
  for (let cookie of cookies) {
    const [cookieName, cookieValue] = cookie.trim().split('=');
    if (cookieName === name) {
      return cookieValue || null;
    }
  }
  return null;
};
```

2. **Reordered Authentication Check Logic**:
- First: Check for existing cookie (persistent state)
- Second: Check for URL parameter (OAuth callback)
- This ensures page reloads work correctly

3. **Enhanced Event Listeners**:
- Added storage event listener for cross-tab synchronization
- Improved window focus handler

4. **Better Error Handling**:
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Automatic cleanup of invalid cookies
- Detailed logging for debugging

### Created Debug Page
- Added `/auth-debug` page to help troubleshoot authentication issues
- Shows real-time cookie values, decoded data, and auth state
- Useful for testing and debugging

## Testing the Fix

1. **Login Flow**:
   - Go to the site
   - Click "Sign in with GitHub"
   - Complete OAuth flow
   - Verify you're logged in

2. **Persistence Test**:
   - After successful login, reload the page (F5)
   - The user should remain logged in (no "Sign in" button)
   - User avatar and dropdown should be visible

3. **Cross-Tab Test**:
   - Login in one tab
   - Open a new tab to the same site
   - Should be automatically logged in

4. **Debug Information**:
   - Visit `/auth-debug` to see detailed authentication state
   - Check cookie values and decoded user data

## Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ **Login persists after page reload**
✅ **No more "Sign in" button appearing after successful authentication**
✅ **Consistent authentication state across browser tabs**
✅ **Proper cookie handling and parsing**
✅ **Better error handling and recovery**

## Backend Cookie Setting (Already Working)

The Python backend in `api/index.py` correctly sets the cookie:
```python
# Production
cookie_value = f'github_user={session_data}; Path=/; Max-Age=86400; SameSite=Lax; Secure'

# Development  
cookie_value = f'github_user={session_data}; Path=/; Max-Age=86400; SameSite=Lax'
```

The issue was purely in the frontend cookie parsing and state management logic.

## Next Steps

1. Test the authentication flow thoroughly
2. Verify persistence across page reloads
3. Check cross-tab synchronization
4. Monitor the debug page for any remaining issues

The authentication should now work reliably and persist properly across page reloads and browser sessions.
