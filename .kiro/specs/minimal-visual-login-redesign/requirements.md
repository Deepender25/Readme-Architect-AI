# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on redesigning both login pages (`/login` and `/switch-account`) to create a minimal, visual-first experience that matches the main site's aesthetic. The goal is to reduce text content while maximizing visual information and ensuring both pages fit within a single viewport without scrolling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the login page, I want a visually appealing interface that matches the main site's design language, so that I have a consistent brand experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits `/login` THEN the page SHALL use the same background component as the main site
2. WHEN the login page loads THEN it SHALL display the main site's color scheme and visual elements
3. WHEN a user sees the login page THEN it SHALL feel like a natural extension of the main site's design
4. IF the main site uses `ProfessionalBackground` component THEN the login pages SHALL use the same component

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want login pages with minimal text but maximum visual information, so that I can quickly understand what actions are available without reading lengthy descriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views either login page THEN the text content SHALL be reduced to essential information only
2. WHEN displaying user actions THEN the interface SHALL use visual cues (icons, colors, layouts) over text descriptions
3. WHEN showing process steps THEN they SHALL be represented visually rather than through lengthy explanations
4. WHEN a user needs to understand functionality THEN visual hierarchy SHALL guide them without excessive reading

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want both login pages to fit entirely within my viewport, so that I don't need to scroll to see all available options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits `/login` THEN the entire page content SHALL fit within the viewport height
2. WHEN a user visits `/switch-account` THEN the entire page content SHALL fit within the viewport height
3. WHEN the page loads on desktop THEN no vertical scrolling SHALL be required
4. WHEN the page loads on mobile THEN no vertical scrolling SHALL be required
5. IF content needs to be displayed THEN it SHALL be organized to fit within single screen height

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user switching GitHub accounts, I want a streamlined visual process, so that I can quickly understand and complete the account switching steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits `/switch-account` THEN the steps SHALL be displayed as visual cards or icons
2. WHEN showing the 3-step process THEN each step SHALL have distinct visual states (active, completed, waiting)
3. WHEN a step is active THEN it SHALL be visually highlighted with colors and animations
4. WHEN a step is completed THEN it SHALL show a clear visual confirmation (checkmark, color change)
5. WHEN steps are waiting THEN they SHALL appear visually inactive but still visible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a returning user, I want to quickly identify and continue with my previous GitHub account, so that I can access the application with minimal friction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a returning user visits `/login` THEN their previous account SHALL be displayed prominently with visual emphasis
2. WHEN showing the previous account THEN it SHALL include user avatar, name, and username in a visually appealing card
3. WHEN the continue option is presented THEN it SHALL be the primary visual action on the page
4. WHEN alternative options exist THEN they SHALL be secondary but still clearly accessible
5. IF no previous account exists THEN the first-time login SHALL be the prominent visual action

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent visual feedback and animations, so that the login experience feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interactive elements are hovered THEN they SHALL provide smooth visual feedback
2. WHEN buttons are clicked THEN they SHALL show appropriate loading or transition states
3. WHEN pages load THEN elements SHALL animate in smoothly to create a polished experience
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be displayed with clear visual styling that matches the design
5. WHEN actions are processing THEN loading states SHALL be visually consistent with the main site
