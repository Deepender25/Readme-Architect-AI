# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a comprehensive, professional URL routing system for the README Generator application. The system will provide clean, SEO-friendly URLs, proper redirects, enhanced security, and a robust navigation structure that follows modern web standards and best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want clean and professional URLs that are easy to read and share, so that I can navigate the application intuitively and share specific pages with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any page THEN the URL SHALL be clean, lowercase, and use hyphens for word separation
2. WHEN a user accesses a URL with trailing slashes THEN the system SHALL redirect to the canonical URL without trailing slashes
3. WHEN a user accesses a URL with uppercase characters THEN the system SHALL redirect to the lowercase equivalent
4. WHEN a user visits nested routes THEN the URL structure SHALL be logical and hierarchical (e.g., /docs/api, /generate/configure)
5. WHEN a user bookmarks a page THEN the URL SHALL remain stable and accessible

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized routing configuration system, so that I can easily manage and maintain all application routes from a single source of truth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN routes are defined THEN they SHALL be centralized in a configuration file with TypeScript types
2. WHEN new routes are added THEN they SHALL be automatically validated and type-checked
3. WHEN route metadata is needed THEN it SHALL be available through the routing system (titles, descriptions, breadcrumbs)
4. WHEN building URLs programmatically THEN helper functions SHALL be available for consistent URL construction
5. WHEN checking route permissions THEN the system SHALL provide utilities to determine if routes require authentication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper navigation breadcrumbs and page hierarchy, so that I can understand my current location and easily navigate to parent pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any page THEN breadcrumbs SHALL be automatically generated based on the URL structure
2. WHEN a user is on a nested page THEN the breadcrumb trail SHALL show the complete path from home to current page
3. WHEN a user clicks on a breadcrumb item THEN they SHALL navigate to that specific level
4. WHEN a user is on the current page THEN the last breadcrumb item SHALL be marked as current and non-clickable
5. WHEN breadcrumbs are displayed THEN they SHALL include proper semantic markup for accessibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper error handling for invalid URLs, so that I receive helpful feedback when accessing non-existent pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses a non-existent route THEN they SHALL see a custom 404 page with navigation options
2. WHEN a server error occurs THEN the user SHALL see a custom 500 page with recovery options
3. WHEN a user accesses a protected route without authentication THEN they SHALL be redirected to login with a return URL
4. WHEN an authenticated user accesses auth-only pages THEN they SHALL be redirected to the dashboard
5. WHEN route validation fails THEN appropriate HTTP status codes SHALL be returned

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a search engine crawler, I want properly structured URLs and metadata, so that I can effectively index and rank the application's pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page is accessed THEN it SHALL have appropriate meta tags (title, description, keywords)
2. WHEN generating URLs THEN they SHALL be SEO-friendly with descriptive segments
3. WHEN serving pages THEN proper canonical URLs SHALL be set to prevent duplicate content issues
4. WHEN redirects occur THEN appropriate HTTP status codes SHALL be used (301 for permanent, 302 for temporary)
5. WHEN sitemaps are generated THEN all public routes SHALL be included with proper priority and change frequency

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast and smooth navigation between pages, so that I can efficiently move through the application without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between pages THEN client-side routing SHALL be used for instant transitions
2. WHEN pages are loading THEN appropriate loading states SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the browser history SHALL be properly managed
4. WHEN using browser back/forward buttons THEN navigation SHALL work correctly
5. WHEN prefetching is enabled THEN likely next pages SHALL be preloaded for faster navigation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive route protection and middleware, so that I can secure the application and implement cross-cutting concerns consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing route protection THEN middleware SHALL check authentication status before serving protected pages
2. WHEN serving API routes THEN proper CORS headers SHALL be set
3. WHEN handling requests THEN security headers SHALL be added to all responses
4. WHEN rate limiting is needed THEN middleware SHALL enforce request limits
5. WHEN logging is required THEN request/response information SHALL be captured consistently

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want internationalization support in URLs, so that I can access the application in my preferred language with localized routes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN language preferences are set THEN URLs SHALL include the locale prefix (e.g., /en/docs, /es/docs)
2. WHEN accessing routes without locale THEN the system SHALL redirect to the default language
3. WHEN switching languages THEN the user SHALL stay on the equivalent page in the new language
4. WHEN generating alternate language links THEN proper hreflang attributes SHALL be set
5. WHEN serving localized content THEN the correct language metadata SHALL be included
