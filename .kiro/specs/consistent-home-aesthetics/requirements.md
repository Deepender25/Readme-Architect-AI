# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on creating a consistent visual experience across all pages of the AutoDoc AI application by applying the beautiful home page aesthetics, design patterns, color palette, and hover effects to every page in the application. The goal is to ensure users have a cohesive, professional, and visually stunning experience regardless of which page they visit.

3. WHEN a user views text content THEN all typography SHALL follow the same hierarchy and color scheme (white for headings, gray-400 for body text, green-400 for accents)
4. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the visual consistency SHALL be maintained across all routes
