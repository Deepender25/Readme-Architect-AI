### 2. Update Production Environment

- [ ] Update ALL environment variables with new credentials
- [ ] Redeploy the application

#### Other Hosting Platforms
- [ ] Update environment variables on your hosting platform
- [ ] Redeploy with new credentials

### 3. Security Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor your Google Cloud billing for unusual activity
- [ ] Check GitHub audit logs for unauthorized access
- [ ] Monitor Supabase logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Set up alerts for unusual API usage

### 4. Team Communication (if applicable)
- [ ] Notify team members about the security incident
- [ ] Ensure everyone re-clones the repository
- [ ] Share new credentials securely (not via email/chat)

## üîç Verification Steps

After completing the above:
- [ ] Test your application with new credentials
- [ ] Verify old credentials no longer work
- [ ] Confirm no sensitive data in git history: `git log --all --full-history -- .env`
- [ ] Check that `.env` is ignored: `git status` should not show .env as untracked
