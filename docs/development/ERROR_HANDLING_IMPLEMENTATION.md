# Error Handling & Email Notification System

## 🎯 Overview

Your README generator now has a comprehensive error handling system that:
- ✅ Shows user-friendly messages instead of fallback templates
- ✅ Sends detailed email notifications for all errors
- ✅ Works for both authenticated and anonymous users
- ✅ Tracks AI failures, API errors, and system issues

## 📧 Email Notification Features

### Automated Error Alerts
When any error occurs in your web app, you'll receive a detailed email with:
- **Error Type & Message**: Clear description of what went wrong
- **Timestamp**: When the error occurred
- **User Information**: Who was affected (username or "Anonymous user")
- **Context Data**: Repository URL, project name, request parameters
- **Stack Traces**: Technical details for debugging

### Email Template
The emails are beautifully formatted with:
- 🚨 Professional error alert design
- 📊 Organized error details in tables
- 🔍 Context information for debugging
- 👤 User information (when available)
- 🐛 Stack traces for technical analysis

## 🛠 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Email Configuration for Error Notifications
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-gmail-app-password

# Optional: Separate email for error notifications
ERROR_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=your-notification@gmail.com
```

### Gmail App Password Setup
1. Enable 2-Step Verification on your Gmail account
2. Go to Google Account Settings > Security > 2-Step Verification > App passwords
3. Generate a 16-character app password
4. Use this app password (not your regular password) in `EMAIL_PASS`

## 🔄 User Experience Changes

### Before (Old System)
When AI failed:
```
❌ User saw: Large fallback template with generic content
❌ No error notifications sent
❌ Hard to debug issues
```

### After (New System)
When AI fails:
```
✅ User sees: "AI generation service is currently unavailable. Our team has been notified and is working to resolve this issue. Please try again in a few minutes."
✅ Developer receives: Detailed email with error information
✅ Easy to track and fix issues
```

## 📊 Error Types Tracked

### 1. AI Generation Failures
- **Trigger**: When Gemini API fails, times out, or returns errors
- **User Message**: Friendly unavailable message
- **Email Details**: Repository URL, project name, exact error message
- **Context**: User info, generation parameters

### 2. API Errors
- **Trigger**: Network issues, repository download failures, parsing errors
- **User Message**: Appropriate error message
- **Email Details**: Endpoint, request data, error details
- **Context**: User info, request parameters

### 3. System Errors
- **Trigger**: Unexpected exceptions, server issues
- **User Message**: General error message
- **Email Details**: Full stack trace and context
- **Context**: Complete error information

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite to verify everything works:

```bash
python test_error_notifications.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Test error logging functionality
- ✅ Test email notification sending
- ✅ Verify user-facing messages
- ✅ Test both authenticated and anonymous user scenarios

## 📁 Implementation Files

### Core Files Created/Modified:

1. **`api/error_notifier.py`** - Central error handling system
2. **`api/generate.py`** - Updated with error notifications
3. **`api/index.py`** - Updated with error notifications
4. **`.env.example`** - Added email configuration
5. **`test_error_notifications.py`** - Comprehensive test suite

### Key Functions:

```python
# Log any error with email notification
log_error(error_type, error_message, context, user_info)

# AI-specific failure notifications
notify_ai_failure(repo_url, project_name, error_message, user_info)

# API error notifications
notify_api_error(endpoint, error_message, request_data, user_info)
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Error Detection
- Every API endpoint is wrapped with error handling
- AI failures are specifically caught and handled
- System errors are caught at the highest level

### 2. Error Processing
- Error details are extracted and formatted
- User information is gathered (when available)
- Context is collected for debugging

### 3. User Response
- Users see friendly, actionable messages
- No technical jargon or scary error codes
- Clear guidance on what to do next

### 4. Developer Notification
- Immediate email alert sent
- Rich HTML formatting for easy reading
- All context needed for debugging
- Timestamp and user tracking

### 5. Logging
