# ðŸ”’ Security Notice - Credential Exposure Fixed

## Issue Resolved
**Date:** October 30, 2024  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED

## What Happened
The `.env` file containing sensitive credentials was accidentally committed to the git repository, exposing:
- Google API Key
- GitHub OAuth Client Secret
- GitHub Personal Access Token
- Email App Password
- Database credentials

## Actions Taken

### âœ… Immediate Response
1. **Git History Cleaned**: Used `git filter-branch` to completely remove `.env` from all git history
2. **Credentials Revoked**: All exposed credentials have been invalidated
3. **Repository Secured**: Force-pushed cleaned history to remove sensitive data from remote
4. **New Credentials Generated**: Fresh API keys and tokens have been created

### âœ… Security Measures Implemented
1. **Enhanced .gitignore**: Verified `.env` is properly ignored
2. **Template Created**: New `.env` file with placeholder values only
3. **Documentation Updated**: Clear instructions for secure credential management

## For Developers

### Setting Up Environment Variables
1. Copy `.env` to create your local environment file
2. Replace all placeholder values with your actual credentials
3. **NEVER commit the `.env` file** - it's already in `.gitignore`

### Required Credentials
- **Google API Key**: Get from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- **GitHub OAuth**: Create app at [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
- **Supabase**: Get credentials from your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
- **Email**: Use Gmail App Password (not regular password)

## Verification
- âœ… No sensitive data in git history: `git log --all --full-history -- .env` returns empty
- âœ… Repository size reduced after cleanup
- âœ… All exposed credentials have been rotated
- âœ… New deployment uses fresh credentials

## Prevention
- All future commits are automatically scanned for sensitive data
- `.env` file is permanently ignored by git
- Team members trained on secure credential management
