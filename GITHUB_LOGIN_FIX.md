# üîß GitHub Login Fix Instructions

## Problem Identified ‚úÖ

Your GitHub login is failing because **Vercel is using the wrong GitHub Client ID**.

- **Current (Wrong)**: `Ov23liJqlWzXgWeeX0NZ`
- **Correct**: `Ov23liq3yu6Ir7scqDXo`

## Solution: Update Vercel Environment Variables

### Step 1: Update Vercel Environment Variables

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Find your `autodocai` project
   - Click on it

2. **Navigate to Settings**:
   - Click on "Settings" tab
   - Click on "Environment Variables" in the sidebar

3. **Update GITHUB_CLIENT_ID**:
   - Find the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` variable
   - Click "Edit" or "..." menu
   - Change the value from `Ov23liJqlWzXgWeeX0NZ` to `Ov23liq3yu6Ir7scqDXo`
   - Click "Save"

4. **Verify Other Variables** (should already be correct):
   - `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: Should match your GitHub OAuth app
   - `GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI`: Should be `https://autodocai.vercel.app/api/auth/callback`

### Step 2: Redeploy Your Application

After updating the environment variables:

1. **Trigger a new deployment**:
   - Go to "Deployments" tab in Vercel
   - Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
   - OR push a small change to your GitHub repository

2. **Wait for deployment to complete** (usually 1-2 minutes)

### Step 3: Test the Login

1. **Visit your app**: https://autodocai.vercel.app/login
2. **Click "Sign in with GitHub"**
3. **You should now be redirected to GitHub successfully**
4. **After authorizing, you should be logged in**

## Verification Commands

After the fix, you can verify it's working:

```bash
# Test the OAuth redirect (should show the correct Client ID)
python -c "
import requests
import re
response = requests.get('https://autodocai.vercel.app/auth/github', allow_redirects=False)
location = response.headers.get('Location', '')
match = re.search(r'client_id=([^&]+)', location)
if match:
    print('Client ID in production:', match.group(1))
    if match.group(1) == 'Ov23liq3yu6Ir7scqDXo':
        print('‚úÖ FIXED! Using correct Client ID')
    else:
        print('‚ùå Still using wrong Client ID')
"
```

## GitHub OAuth App Settings

Make sure your GitHub OAuth app (with Client ID `Ov23liq3yu6Ir7scqDXo`) has these settings:

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/settings/developers
2. **Find your OAuth app** with Client ID `Ov23liq3yu6Ir7scqDXo`
3. **Verify these settings**:
   - **Application name**: AutoDoc AI (or your preferred name)
   - **Homepage URL**: `https://autodocai.vercel.app`
   - **Authorization callback URL**: `https://autodocai.vercel.app/api/auth/callback`

## Common Issues After Fix

If login still doesn't work after the fix:

1. **Clear browser cache and cookies**
2. **Try incognito/private browsing mode**
3. **Check if the GitHub OAuth app is suspended**
4. **Verify the Client Secret is also correct in Vercel**

## Need Help?

If you're still having issues after following these steps:

1. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
2. **Verify the Vercel environment variables** were saved correctly
3. **Make sure the deployment completed** successfully
4. **Test with a different browser** or device

---

**The main issue was that Vercel's environment variables didn't match your local .env file. Once you update the Vercel environment variables with the correct Client ID, GitHub login should work perfectly! üöÄ**
